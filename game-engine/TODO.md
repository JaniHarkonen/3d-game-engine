# TODO

- improve rendering
- improve uniforms
- IAssets may have to implement a getPath-method
- make IGame or AGame to completely separate 'engine' package from the 'game' package
- change name of model matrix (uModel) to object matrix (uObject) as model refers to a class that does not have a transform and thus no matrix of its own
- default diffuse color in material is 0.8 0.8 0.8 1.0 for some reason, should be 1.0 1.0 1.0 1.0
